# Sem5 PI 24-25: Surgical Appointment and Resource Management System

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a prototype for managing surgical appointments and resources within healthcare facilities. The system will help hospitals and clinics manage surgery requests, patient records, and appointments, providing real-time 3D visualizations of resource availability and optimized scheduling. Additionally, the system will ensure compliance with GDPR regulations and address business continuity considerations.

## Scope

The project involves creating a web-based application with the following modules:

1. **Backoffice Web Application**: Manages administrative tasks, user roles, and profiles for patients and staff.
2. **3D Visualization Module**: Provides real-time visual representations of facility resources and availability.
3. **Planning/Optimization Module**: Optimizes surgery scheduling based on resource availability.
4. **GDPR Module**: Ensures data compliance with GDPR standards.
5. **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)**: Ensures system reliability and data recovery processes.

## Goals

- Implement a full-stack application involving REST APIs, database management, 3D rendering, and optimization using Prolog.
- Address GDPR compliance, particularly in managing patient data and user privacy rights.
- Ensure modular integration so that dependencies between modules (e.g., 3D visualization and scheduling) are properly managed.

## Project Workflow

The project is divided into three sprints over 14 weeks, each focusing on planning, development, testing, and review:

1. **Sprint Planning**: Define tasks, priorities, and dependencies, and assign responsibilities.
2. **Development Phases**: Collaborate across modules, conduct code reviews, and integrate system components.
3. **Testing and Review**: Conduct tests to ensure functionality across all modules, with a particular focus on module dependencies and GDPR compliance.
4. **Customer Feedback**: Present progress at the end of each sprint to gather feedback and make adjustments.
5. **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflect on challenges, successes, and areas for improvement.

## System Components

### Backoffice Module

The backoffice module allows administrators to manage:

- **Users**: Admins, healthcare staff (doctors, nurses, technicians), and patients.
- **Operations**: Creation, scheduling, and optimization of surgery appointments.
- **Rooms and Resources**: Real-time availability and status of rooms and equipment.

### 3D Visualization Module

This module visualizes the hospital layout and resource availability, integrating with the scheduling module to reflect real-time updates.

### Planning/Optimization Module

This module manages surgery schedules and optimizes resource allocation by:

- Generating and updating surgery schedules.
- Considering criteria such as resource availability and priority settings.

### GDPR Module

This module ensures that the system aligns with GDPR guidelines, including user consent, data access control, and data deletion requests.

### Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

The BCP module ensures system resilience, enabling data recovery and continuous operations in case of system failures.

## Key Functionalities

- **User Management**: Admin registration, patient self-registration, and role-based access control.
- **Scheduling and Optimization**: Efficient resource scheduling to prevent conflicts.
- **3D Resource Visualization**: Real-time rendering of hospital resources.
- **GDPR Compliance**: Control over user data access, updates, and deletion.

## Conclusion

This project provides a structured, hands-on approach to developing a multi-functional system for healthcare resource management. By integrating various modules, the team will create a comprehensive prototype addressing both functional and regulatory requirements.
